The attached data captures some details about new Food and Beverage (F&B) product launches across the world.  Below are some notes around various files. 

	Product Launch Dataset.csv
a)	The column names are self-explanatory; feel free to make relevant assumptions. 		
b)	Each product could come in combination of multiple flavors. Each unique flavor used in a product is separated from another by a semicolon (;). 
E.g. Product ID #10 states: “Cherry, not specified; Vanilla, not specified.” This means product #10 comes in a combination of two unique flavors. The first flavor “Cherry, not specified” means the flavor is Cherry but it is not mentioned what particular type of Cherry flavor is used (e.g Red Cherry or Black Cherry). Similarly, for the second flavour. 
c)	The “Launch date” represents the date on which a product was launched. 

	Flavor Classification Dataset. csv
Maps each unique flavor to a “Flavor Group”.

	Positioning Category Mapping Dataset. csv
Each product (as specified by a product ID) could come in combination of multiple positioning categories. This file maps each unique positioning category to a “Positioning Group”.
